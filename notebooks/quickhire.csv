1590,Legal Sea Foods, LLC.,"Legal Sea Foods was born in 1950 when George Berkowitz opened a fish market in the Inman Square neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts. He opened it adjacent to his father Harry's grocery store Legal Cash Market where customers were given ""Legal Stamps"" (forerunners of S&H green stamps) with their purchases. It's here that the ""Legal"" name became synonymous with quality and freshness.  

In 1968, the Berkowitz family opened its first seafood restaurant, right next to the fish market. The fish was simply prepared, either broiled or fried, and served on paper plates at communal picnic tables.  Despite the low-key trappings, the food was second to none and word quickly spread.  This early success led to further expansion and now, six decades later with restaurants along the Eastern Seaboard, the family philosophy endures:  Legal Sea Foods is a fish company in the restaurant business.

George's son, Roger, has been at the helm since 1992 and has expanded the business into new markets while maintaining the company's focus on its proud tradition and core values.  So when we say, ""If it isn't fresh, it isn't Legal!,"" we renew a commitment that has sustained us for over a half-century.

We are ""fanatics for freshness""® and quality - so much so, that we built our own state-of-the-art fish processing plant and food safety laboratory.  

We impose the very highest standards for quality, sanitation and safety at every step - from purchase, to processing, to shipping and finally to preparation in our restaurants.  And we've been doing this for years. Back in the 1990s, the FDA partnered with us in establishing the seafood inspection program known as Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP).

Our controls in place at our Quality Control Center enable us to follow our fish from pier to plate.  In other words, we can trace the fish you ordered back to the waters in which it was caught.

It's not a fish tale, but a tale of fish 60 years in the making…of a family-owned seafood market that spawned a restaurant company."

1729,Mercy,"Our Mercy health system was founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1986. But our heritage goes back more than 185 years. It began with an Irish woman named Catherine McAuley, who wanted to help the poor women and children of Dublin. Though Catherine had a modest upbringing, she received an unexpected inheritance that allowed her to fulfill her dreams. In 1827, she opened the first House of Mercy in Dublin, intending to teach skills to poor women and educate children. Many volunteers came to help. A few years later, Catherine founded the Sisters of Mercy, the first religious order not bound to the rules of the cloister, whose Sisters were free to walk among the poor and visit them in their homes. By the time Catherine died in 1841, there were convents in Ireland and England, and in 1843, the Sisters of Mercy came to the United States. In 1871, they traveled to St. Louis and from there throughout the Midwest, beginning what would, today be known as Mercy.  

Mercy, named one of the top five large U.S. health systems in 2018, 2017 and 2016 by IBM Watson Health, serves millions annually. Mercy includes more than 40 acute care and specialty (heart, children's, orthopedic and rehab) hospitals, 800 physician practices and outpatient facilities, 44,000 co-workers and 2,100 Mercy Clinic physicians in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. Mercy also has clinics, outpatient services and outreach ministries in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. In addition, Mercy's IT division, Mercy Technology Services, supply chain organization, ROi, and Mercy Virtual commercially serve providers and patients in more than 20 states coast to coast."

**We’re a world class company.**

At OpenText, we offer the stability of a blue chip and the spirit of a start-up.

OpenText launched in 1991 as a small spin-off company from the University of Waterloo in Canada. Twenty-two years later, we’re a truly global company with more than 8200 employees in over 140 offices around the world.

We’ve grown to $1.3B annual revenue in 2013. And, most impressive has been our consistent upward growth, steered by an experienced leadership team.

  * **Excellence:** What we do, we do well. The highest form of excellence is mastery

**Diversity makes us strong.**

At OpenText, we serve customers of many cultures in many different countries.

We embrace diversity because we believe the best products, solutions, and customer service results from a workplace in which varied viewpoints are welcomed and encouraged.

2323,Preferred Systems Solutions, Inc.,"Preferred Systems Solutions, Inc. (PSS) is an award winning Information Technology (IT) services provider delivering high quality business solutions for the entire government sector with practices in the Department of Defense, Civil Agencies and state and local Government.   

Founded in 1991, PSS was originally focused on providing information technology and engineering services to the commercial market. After building a successful commercial staffing practice, in 1998 PSS sold its commercial business to a publicly owned company. PSS then shifted its mission to providing information technology, engineering, and program management services to Government agencies. In September 2007, PSS was recapitalized by CM Equity Partners and its affiliates (CMEP). In March 2009, PSS acquired Integrated Network Services, Inc. (INSI), an information technology company specializing in supporting mission critical systems and applications in the intelligence and defense communities. Today, PSS enjoys continued success in the expansion of our client base through our dedication to our customer’s mission success. PSS has a proven history of providing reliable, cost-effective solutions to meet our clients’ goals and objectives in the core areas of information technology, engineering, and program management.  

PSS has a strong and diverse Government and commercial client base with key customer relationships with the Department of Defense, Intelligence and Civilian agencies. Our customers include the US Army, the US Navy, the US Air Force, the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Logistics Agency, the Department of State, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Commerce. PSS corporate headquarters is located in Vienna, VA with satellite offices in Lexington Park, MD; Norfolk, VA; and Fairview Heights, IL. Additionally, PSS has numerous field locations at sites across the country, including Hines, IL, Ft. Collins, CO, Hickam Air Force Base, HI; Battle Creek, MI; Jefferson City, MO, and Columbus, OH.  

PSS has the customer focus of a small business with the capabilities of a large company. Although PSS is a large business with revenues exceeding $50M annually, we employ a flat, agile organizational structure that allows us to respond quickly to our customers’, partners’, and employees’ needs.  

Our executive management team has worked together for over ten years and we employ a highly talented and educated workforce that is accustomed to supporting mission-critical systems for our Government and commercial clients in the areas in Information Technology, Engineering and Program Management. Our executive management team employs an “open door” policy and encourages our program managers to utilize all of PSS’ technical resources to implement innovation within their programs. It is not uncommon for PSS to engage expertise from outside a PSS program to ensure a rapid response to our customers' needs. At PSS customer satisfaction is our number one priority and prompt, accurate response to customer needs goes a long way to making that priority a reality."

2569,SNAP,"## **Our Story**

The name may have changed over the years, but the commitment made when the forerunner of SNAP (Spokane Neighborhood Action Partners) formed in 1966 remains its guiding purpose today. SNAP's mission was, and is, to provide people of low income with access to needed resources, and to help them make the kinds of connections that create opportunity. Our goal always has been to help build a vibrant community that treats everyone with dignity and respect by advocating for that which is fair, honorable and equitable.

The foundation for what is now SNAP got its start in the summer of 1966, when Father Frank Bach, then the director of Catholic Charities in Spokane, enlisted the assistance of the St. Vincent DePaul Society to establish three community centers, in Hillyard, East Central and West Central Spokane, each with a goal of helping low-income people meet their emergency needs as well as to provide a multitude of services within those communities.

These centers and the community-based programs they initiated were so successful that the Spokane Community Action Agency took over the administration of the neighborhood centers. Unfortunately, that agency lost its funding in the summer of 1973. The programs would have been lost were it not for the intervention of a number of community leaders. New funding was secured and Catholic Charities again administered the program.

Striving to fill growing needs, the Neighborhood Centers had developed an annual budget in excess of $4 million by 1985 and were growing beyond the scope of Catholic Charities. On September 12, 1985, with Tom Pleas as Director, the centers became Spokane Neighborhood Centers, Inc. The incorporators were: P.J. Grabicki, Thelma Pugh, Robert Huckabay, Sheri Barnard, Clarence (Bud) Barnes, Nora Beggs, Ed Stevens and Bill Fearn. The corporation adopted bylaws on December 10, 1985.

Five years after incorporation, leadership shifted with the announced retirement of Director Pleas. The agency's associate director, Larry Stuckart, was formally named executive director in July 1992. Julie Honekamp assumed the role of SNAP and SNAP Financial Access CEO in June of 2011.

From 1985 through the present, the agency has expanded services to meet the needs of a growing population, proving itself to be more than just ""neighborhood centers."" Through continuing expansion and a variety of programs, the agency strives to facilitate long-term solutions for the people it serves.

The agency officially became Spokane Neighborhood Action Programs in December 1991, a name chosen to reflect the breadth of the agency's operations. In Sheri S. Barnard's Mayoral Proclamation, the agency pledged to continue providing quality services and to ensure that Spokane remains a place that cares about its citizens. In 2008, the name was officially shortened to ""SNAP"" and legally changed to Spokane Neighborhood Action Partners.

With a re-energized mission, vision and values statement, as well as a new visual identity, SNAP continues to respond to individual and community needs by providing a range of opportunities that offer stability to our vulnerable neighbors and encourage economic self-sufficiency for those who are able."

2876,Convergenz,"**""An Opportunity to Help""**  

It started on day one. Convergenz, LLC began in July 2000, at what was fast evolving into the “Dot Com bust” and a rapid rise in unemployment. Our own customers were getting laid off en masse and sending us their resumes, desperate for work. Despite the recession that followed, little by little, we were able to successfully help find people opportunities; and as a company survive this difficult time in our economy. Over ten years later, our mission of connecting people with jobs has never seemed more important.   

By the nature of the Staffing Industry, Convergenz is in a unique position to help, and positively affect peoples’ lives. For over a decade we have been able to assist professionals through historically turbulent times in the American economy. From the Dot-Com bubble, through the post 9/11 wave of layoffs, and the “Great Recession” of 2008—we have been able to offer help and resources to people who have needed access to new career opportunities. Whether it was making a major career change, or simply needing to be placed on a contract assignment to get through “right now”—we hope that we are able to help our consultants and clients through these times of uncertainty.   

When we think of what sets us apart from our competition, we immediately come back to the fact that we have big company success but do it with a small company touch. Hands on, no red-tape, responsive to peoples’ needs, inquiries, and requests. In other words—Provide Great Service All the Time. When we founded Convergenz, we set out to build a firm that we would want to work for. Be a successful business – but do it the right way, in the boardroom and in the community.   

Every day is an exercise in self-reflection —we look to get better, to learn, and grow. We set out to make a positive difference every day, and take pride in the results."

**What we believe.**   

We believe relationships are built on trust. That our lives and our work matter. And that doing what’s right is good for everyone — our clients, our employees, our financial representatives and our communities.   

These beliefs launched our company nearly 160 years ago. Today, they’re just a few of the reasons why people choose to build careers at Northwestern Mutual.   

**We’re known for our financial strength.**   

That means we’ll be here for the millions of people who are counting on us—our clients, our employees, our financial representatives and our communities.

**We care.**   

We make a positive difference in our communities. Nationally, thousands have benefited from our support of research and programs to fight childhood cancer. Each year, our Foundation, employees and financial representatives donate time, talent and financial support to causes they’re passionate about.

# Why Work Here

**We’re strong and growing.**   

In a company with such a long and storied history, this may be the most exciting and important time to be a part of Northwestern Mutual. We’re strong, innovative and growing. And we want you to grow with us.   

**We invest in our people.**   

We provide opportunities for employees to grow themselves, their careers, and, in turn, our business. Movement around the company is encouraged and we help our people build meaningful, long-term careers.

**Be part of building our future.**   

We’re expanding our campus in downtown Milwaukee overlooking Lake Michigan. The Northwestern Mutual Tower and Commons will include a state-of-the-art employee Learning Institute, and will feature a natural light-filled, 21st century work environment. This signature development reinforces our commitment to job growth, attracting top talent and drawing new business to Milwaukee. 

**Enjoy Milwaukee.**   

Located on beautiful Lake Michigan, Milwaukee offers a perfect balance of big city and small town living. Home to Summerfest, the world’s largest music festival, Milwaukee has a thriving music scene, a celebrated annual film festival and vibrant performing arts community. Professional sports teams include the Milwaukee Brewers, Milwaukee Bucks and other major teams. And outdoor family fun is easy here. An extensive urban bike path network links our lakefront parks, beaches and other recreational hotspots. 

# Our Culture

**We are always evolving.**   

At Northwestern Mutual, our employees, and our business, are always evolving. We are agile and continuously learning and improving. We have a work environment that empowers problem solving and encourages innovation—you will make an impact here.   

**We do what’s right.**   

Our “do-what’s-right” value is pervasive. We ask ourselves: “Is this in the best interest of our clients? Our employees? Our financial representatives?” Acting on this value improves our clients’ experience, and makes Northwestern Mutual a better place to work.

**We recognize and develop possibilities in our people.**   

Onsite training and leadership development programs help employees succeed and grow. We also sponsor learning opportunities outside the company to help employees stay current in their fields, network with peers and gain external perspective. 

**Diversity makes us better.**   

We believe diversity and inclusion cultivate creativity, innovation and a better experience for our clients. That’s why we recruit and grow people who bring unique perspectives, ideas, beliefs and cultural backgrounds."

2865,PRO SOURCE,"Pro Source is an engineering recruiting firm that began in 1984 providing consulting services and contract personnel to support mechanical engineering, CAD, electrical engineering, manufacturing engineering, quality engineering and software engineering.

Every single day we see a puzzle being created that needs to be solved. In the hiring process, companies want great people and have problems fitting the right piece in the right place. Additionally, from the candidate’s perspective, the puzzle is created when they know they are the right fit for a role and an organization and can’t get the attention they deserve to insert the right piece. Inserting the wrong piece into the puzzle on either side causes problems for both.

3348,Daley and Associates,Daley And Associates was originally created to fill a void in the search and staffing industry. As former executives in one of the world’s largest search and staffing firms, the current Partners of Daley And Associates began to notice that the industry was becoming increasingly transactional, which doesn’t make much sense for an industry that deals solely with people. In 2005 we decided to start a different kind of search and staffing firm - a firm that has big industry knowledge with small company quality; because we believe there is more to staffing than matching a resume to a job order.

Led by our Chairman, Roy Kapani, and an experienced executive leadership team, ECS provides our customers with solutions and services that support their critical needs and further mission objectives. This commitment has paved the way for expansive growth, year over year.   

ECS gained market share in 2011 in the Department of Defense and Federal spaces through both organic and acquisition growth. In May, ECS completed its first strategic acquisition with the purchase of OAK Management, Inc., a leading provider of marine environmental services, ship systems engineering, maritime consulting and platform acquisition management. The OAK acquisition kicked off ECS’ intention to add tactical acquisitions as a part of its long term strategy to supplement and expand upon organic growth and to build enterprise value. ECS closed out 2011 with the acquisition of Paradigm Technologies, Inc. The Paradigm transaction added approximately 200 employees to ECS’ existing 900+ employees. Paradigm also added new Defense clients for ECS, including the Missile Defense Agency, the Navy’s Program Executive Officer for Integrated Warfare Systems, the United States Marine Corps, and the U.S. Marshals Service.   

In 2012, ECS completed the acquisition of iLuMinA Solutions, Inc. iLuMinA brings large-scale Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software implementation and infrastructure design and development to ECS’ expanding capabilities.   

ECS will continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and quality processes as we grow and enhance our ability to offer professional excellence to both our customers and our employees."

## Heritage

Manson Construction Co. has a proud and longstanding history in the heavy civil construction and dredging market.

Established in Seattle in 1905 by an enterprising Swedish immigrant named Peter Manson, the company quickly developed an enviable reputation for good, honest, hard work which was completed in a timely manner. In time, it became evident that larger equipment was necessary for new technology steel and concrete structures. Peter Manson's innovation and imagination allowed him to expand the size and number of his floating equipment fleet as well as the number of employees. Peter Manson's vision allowed the company to expand its areas of operation outside of the Pacific Northwest; finding work all over North America.

Headquarters remain in Seattle, Washington with operations strategically located in Northern and Southern California, Louisiana, and Florida; managing much of the work that keeps Manson at the forefront of the marine construction and dredging industries.

1274,HCL Technologies Ltd.,"HCL America was established in 1989 and is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.It soon became a prominent IT company in America.   

HCL leverages its decades of global consulting and IT services expertise to create strong, long lasting relationships with its diverse group of Fortune 1000 customers across the Aerospace & Automotive, Energy & Utilities, Financial Services (Banking, Capital Markets & Insurance), Government, Hi-Tech & Manufacturing, Life Sciences & Healthcare, Media & Entertainment, Retail & CPG and Telecommunication industries.   

A radical assessment of the market in 2005 led to a massive internal transformation at HCL and based on customer insights, the company established Services+ portfolios that span the aforementioned vertical industries, thus transforming IT in America.These portfolios include:   

IT Transformation: APO, SOA & Middleware, ERP, ADM, Legacy, Web Technologies, Content Management, Independent Verification & Validation)   

Operations Transformation: Applications/ ERP Maintenance and Operations, Infrastructure management and Operations, BPO)   

Technology Transformation: Software Engineering, Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Software as a Service (SaaS)   

With a focus on 'value centricity', HCL pioneered the management concept of 'Employee First, Customer Second', empowering its employees to better serve its customers through fresh and innovative approaches. One of the program's initiatives was the addition of graduates from top U.S. schools such as the University of Michigan, Northwestern, NYU, Notre Dame and Duke, as well as through customer engagements designed to overcome cultural and business nuances. Other concepts such as transformational engagements, outcome-based-pricing and multi-service delivery also became the cornerstone of HCL's strategy.

#### About Us

As the third largest not-for-profit health system in the United States, we are committed to providing for the needs of our communities - especially for those who are poor and vulnerable - across Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon and Washington.

Our system includes more than 82,000 caregivers (all employees) serving in a diverse range of ministries from birth to end of life, including acute care, physician clinics, long-term and assisted living, palliative and hospice care, home health, supportive housing and education.

#### Where we serve

We operate 34 hospitals, 600 physician clinics, 22 long-term care facilities, 19 hospice and home health programs and 693 supportive housing units in 14 locations. Our health plan serves our caregivers and other large employer groups covering 513,000 members.

On any given day, we care for more than 1,200 people in our long-term care settings, more than 4,000 in our hospitals and more than 15,000 in our clinic settings. Daily, we serve more than 7,000 people in our many home health and palliative care programs and almost 800 in supportive housing. We touch more than five times as many lives in non-acute settings as we do in the traditional hospital setting.

#### A tradition of caring for everyone

When the Sisters arrived in the Pacific Northwest in 1856, they came to answer a call for help from a new pioneer community. What they found were many communities in need of service, and so with dedication to the Mission and collaboration with like-minded partners, their ministry grew to what is now a five-state health system.

Providence Health & Services continues a tradition of caring that the Sisters of Providence began more than 158 years ago. The cornerstone of our Mission is to provide compassionate care that is accessible for all - especially those who are poor and vulnerable.

**Contingency Permanent Placement- HeadHunting**  

We identify, evaluate and introduce employees for your permanent staff. We earn our fee when the individual becomes your employee and remains on your payroll until the guarantee period expires.  

**Temporary To Permanent**  

We identify the individual; perform an evaluation; introduce the applicant and you make the selection. We will put the person on our payroll for a defined period of time after which you make her/him a permanent member of your staff. The specific terms will be negotiated on a case by case basis which may include no additional fee or a reduced fee depending on the initial terms. The advantage of this approach allows you to evaluate the individual on a daily basis before deciding to “permanentize” her/him and, to spread your costs out over an extended period.  

**Staff Augmentation**  

We will provide you a contractor for a temporary period of time. This approach is implemented when the client: 1. needs people to complete a project and has no anticipated need after completion; 2. does not have a permanent “head count” budget; or 3. when the client has been unable to identify an individual with a required expertise on an expeditious basis. During the term of the assignment, should the client wish to permanently employ the contractor, The Consortium will be pleased to negotiate terms amenable to the client.  

**Retained Search**  

Retained searches are entered into when the client desires fully focused recruitment of a key individual. This arrangement requires that The Consortium use its full resources including its network of friends of the company, sourcing and researching. The Consortium commits to a one hundred percent effort on behalf of the retainer client only and guarantees that applicants identified for this undertaking will not be referred to other clients until a release is granted. The Consortium, after identifying candidates, will have an appropriate Advisory Board member assist in evaluation. A resume, references and a Consortium profile will be provided to the client prior to interview and The Consortium personnel will remain intimately involved throughout the entire process."

2915,Starbucks,"Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better. It was true when the first Starbucks opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.

Back then, the company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. From just a narrow storefront, Starbucks offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name, inspired by Moby Dick, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.

In 1981, Howard Schultz (Starbucks chairman and chief executive officer) had first walked into a Starbucks store. From his first cup of Sumatra, Howard was drawn into Starbucks and joined a year later.

In 1983, Howard traveled to Italy and became captivated with Italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience. He had a vision to bring the Italian coffeehouse tradition back to the United States. A place for conversation and a sense of community. A third place between work and home. He left Starbucks for a short period of time to start his own Il Giornale coffeehouses and returned in August 1987 to purchase Starbucks with the help of local investors.

From the beginning, Starbucks set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection."

We serve world champion sports teams, Fortune 500 companies, state-of-the-art healthcare providers and the world’s leading educational institutions. And every day, we dream of ways to do it better through our commitment to innovation and our passion for excellent customer service.

**Innovation inspired by you**  

The better we know the people we serve, the greater the experiences we can develop. Whether it’s food service, facilities or uniforms, our proprietary programs allow us to understand the wants and needs of our audiences. 

Armed with that knowledge, our Service Stars spring into action, combining insights and ingenuity to deliver moments that make a difference. These innovations could be game-changing campus transformations. Or a simpler, quicker way for you to access condiments at the ballpark. In any case, our innovations help create experiences that make an impact.

**Beyond great service**  

Another key part of what makes us different is something we call service excellence.

To us, service excellence isn’t just about providing great customer service. It also means using time-tested practices and proven processes to get it right every day, everywhere, in everything that we do. And it's also about striking the perfect balance between doing something well over and over again and being responsive enough to the changing needs of clients and customers. It’s being open to the continuing cycle of innovation. Excellent, but never satisfied. Process-driven, but never locked in place.

We never stop thinking of new, better ways to get it right when our people impact the lives of clients and consumers every day.

**Our people make all the difference—we make sure of it**  

Our commitment to hiring, training and rewarding the right people ensures that our employees are more than just hard workers. They’re Service Stars, and that means they can be counted on to go above and beyond, every single day.

We understand that many times our people are literally the face of your business. That’s why all 270,000 Service Stars receive continual access to professional development and proprietary skills training. 

The bottom line is this: when you work with Aramark, you can be confident you’ll be collaborating with the right people with the right skills and the right attitude. That’s true whether it’s for strategic expertise, operational excellence or just serving a morning coffee. That’s our commitment as trusted partners and Service Stars. That’s the Aramark way."

What began with bringing clean water to the worksite quickly moved into super-functional, best in class ice chests. Igloo products made the family outdoor recreation movement of the 20th century possible.

As we approach our next century, Igloo is 1200 employees strong. We are proud to call—a 1.8 million square-foot, three-building facility in—Katy, Texas home. With more than 500 products sold at hundreds of retailers around the globe, we can confidently call ourselves the number one cooler manufacturer in the world.

And through it all we haven’t lost sight of our original goal—to create products that enable the pursuit of happiness (however you define it). That’s why we’re still working hard every day to innovate, create, and make it easier for you to get out, work hard and play even harder."

## Let us share our success with you

The heritage of VALiNTRY Services, LLC., is grounded in two of the co-founders working together in late 1999. Their collaboration led to developing one of the largest private intranet, clinical management operating systems supporting over 7,000 physical therapists, occupational therapists and speech-language pathologists who provided therapy in more than 1,300 settings across the United States. This application managed medical records, plan of treatments and Individual Education Plans (IEPs) for the therapy recipients 24/7, including billing, security, and state and federal compliance functions. Wide in scope, this highly successful project received recognition in [CIO Magazine](http://cio.com/) and instilled the knowledge in our co-founders. From this they discovered how powerful creating and matching the correct software solutions to specific technology, processes, and people plays in supporting great success.

In 2013, these co-founders joined forces again along with some additional team members to create VALiNTRY. They built an IT consulting company capable of helping organizations create custom business solutions to support success and a staff augmentation division that provides ""just-in-time"" resources. This strategic approach allows us to maintain a satisfied core consulting team and then ramp up as appropriate for larger projects, while allowing us to provide an attractive pricing model to our customers.

Wolf Peak International, Inc. (WPI) was founded in Layton, Utah by a young entrepreneur, Kurt Daems, in 1998. For the first three years the business operated from a rented basement room while inventory was kept in a storage unit. In 2001, the company's successes allowed for relocation to a small 1,900-square-foot office where the first employee was hired.   

The company experienced phenomenal growth and built its basic foundations in offering a premium experience to its business partners. Marketing the brand Edge Eyewear, WPI became the first company ever to offer designer safety-rated glasses. They began to innovate several new technologies - including being the first company to make polarized safety eyewear - and promote to new markets that had not been attempted by any other safety eyewear brand.   

Consequently, WPI tripled its workforce and was bursting at the seams by February of 2005 - it was time to move. The company relocated to a beautiful, custom-designed 15,000-square-foot office warehouse in Layton, Utah, which once again became too small for the business' growth. In 2015 a larger warehouse was added on to the existing office, increasing the building size to 27,000 and making room for twice as much office space.   

Today, Edge Eyewear is known for its exceptionally designed products, marketing literature, displays, website, and packaging. WPI currently maintains three divisions: Edge Eyewear sells safety-rated eyewear through U.S. industrial, hardware, and utilities distribution accounts. Edge Eyewear Canada, launched in 2009, supplies the same industries through Canadian distribution. Edge Tactical Eyewear began in 2012 and sells tactical eyewear through U.S. law enforcement, military, and shooting sports distributors. The company continues to see consistent growth as a result of its commitment to innovation, creativity, service, and enthusiasm.

Our Mission

We are committed to the following:

  * Creating designer safety-rated eyewear that merges cutting-edge fashion and comfort

  * Pioneering and incorporating emerging technologies and classic features into our products

  * Providing all business partners with a premium experience

  * Offering valuable training opportunities about ANSI specifications to safety professionals

  * Educating eyewear users about safety standards, proper fit, frame selection, lens technologies, ultraviolet radiation, and general optical health and safety practices

  * Hiring individuals who create positive results, facilitate efficiency, increase profitability, and contribute to expansion in an ever-changing organization"

After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis. U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it.

Who believed fashion was fun, and should never be taken too seriously. Patterns, pops of color, new shapes and never-before-seen styles—he embraced it all, rewriting the rules and redefining American sportswear. A constantly evolving pursuit of the unique, the modern, and above all, something to have fun with. That ethos earned him accolades—including the Coty Award for his first show in 1979, which he would go on to win 8 more times, and the CFDA Designer of the Year Award in 1982. And in 1984, he became the head of the CFDA—a major influence on designers then, and now, his legacy is one with the American fashion industry.  

The Perry Ellis ethos hasn’t changed. Since that first unapologetically American collection in 1976, Perry Ellis clothes have been designed to be distinctively unexpected—clothing that stands out, but always appropriate. Made for the way people work, live, and play today—especially since, these days, those often happen all at once. Perry Ellis is a global lifestyle brand that includes a full sportswear collection as well as a full range of categories spanning fragrance, watches, footwear and more—but still believes, as Perry himself said, in never taking itself or style too seriously. Because modern style means only one thing: Being very true to yourself."

Our commitment to environmental sustainability is reflected in the investments we make. Here are some of the many ways Metrolink has invested in a cleaner future for Southern California:

![Tier 4 Locomotive](https://www.metrolinktrains.com/globalassets/about/tier4_loco.jpg)

  *  **The New Tier 4.**  Metrolink is proud to become the first commuter rail system in the nation to operate new locomotives powered by Tier 4 clean technology. Tier 4 locomotives are the cleanest diesel locomotives in the nation and are up to 85% cleaner than our old locomotives. They have two-thirds more horsepower and are equipped with the latest safety upgrades.

  *  **Greater connectivity.**  Metrolink is the only transportation provider that serves the entire six-county area of Southern California. We also connect you to more free transfers and travel options, so you can leave your car at home or at the station. Your valid Metrolink fare connects you to city bus, shuttle bus, light rail, and subway lines, taking you farther than ever before. 

  *  **Bike trains and facilities.**  Metrolink promotes the use of bikes on our trains. Our fleet includes specialty Bike Cars that can hold up to 18 bikes, and most Metrolink stations offer bike racks or lockers for passengers. 

  *  **Electric vehicle recharging stations.**  Seventeen Metrolink stations are equipped with electric vehicle charging stations. 

![Solar panels](https://www.metrolinktrains.com/globalassets/tickets/solar_parking_lot1.jpg)

  *  **S** **olar-paneled parking structures.**  In 2012, Metrolink's Industry Station added 8,300 solar panels, creating a solar carport that generates up to 2.2 megawatts per hour while shading 940 parking spaces, the largest renewable energy project of its kind in Southern California. The station generates revenue for the city, and also provides 64 charging stalls for Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs).

  *  **Greener buildings.**  Our Dispatch and Operations Center (DOC) in Pomona has LEED Silver certification, conserving resources and promoting clean, renewable energy. 75% of its construction waste was recycled. It was built with 20% recycled material and uses 16% less energy with features like LED lighting. Building water use was reduced by 40%, and site water use by 50%, by using low flow devices and landscape treatments which allow for natural filtration.

11791,The CNA Corporation,"CNA's approach to research is a modern iteration of the Newtonian principle that complex, dynamic processes are best understood through direct observation of events and people.   

That was the methodology CNA analysts first applied in the 1940s when they pioneered the field of operations research by helping the Navy address the German U-boat threat. Not content to study the problem from afar, this small group of MIT scientists insisted on deploying with Navy forces in order to observe operations and collect the data needed for meaningful analyses. Their groundbreaking work, and the anti-submarine warfare equations it produced, set a standard for operations research methods that CNA has maintained for 75 years.   

Today, with more than 500 professionals at our headquarters and 50 researchers in the field, CNA still takes a multi-disciplinary, real-world approach to our work. On-site analysts carefully observe all aspects of a process—people, decisions, actions, consequences—and then collaborate with a headquarters-based research team to assess data and arrive at findings.   

CNA's objective, empirical research and analysis helps decision makers develop sound policies, make better-informed decisions, and manage programs more effectively. Our work, which in its early decades focused solely on defense-related matters, has grown to include investigation and analysis of a broad range of national security, defense, and public interest issues including education, homeland security and air traffic management. Through our Center for Naval Analyses and Institute for Public Research, we provide public-sector organizations with the tools they need to tackle the complex challenges of making government more efficient and keeping our country safe and strong."

13470,Hanna Andersson,"Who is Hanna?  

**The ""original"" Hanna**  

The original Hanna Andersson was my grandmother. She had a way with babies and lived in Skåne near the Baltic Sea. Grandmother taught me the Swedish tradition of choosing the best quality she could find – and using things for a long, long time!   

Hanna began with cotton clothes that I brought to America for my own children over 20 years ago, but it is dedicated to my grandmother, and the standard of quality that she represents to me – quality with love and understanding.   

**My baby son started it all**  

Yes, my son started it all. I began thinking seriously about a children's clothing business in America when I couldn't find beautiful quality pure cotton baby clothes like those I'd known in Sweden! After watching friends go wild over some soft Swedish cotton knits that we brought back to America, the big idea for our first little catalog was born. Late in 1983, our ""best little children's catalog ever"" was produced in Sweden in two whirlwind weeks, and the Hanna Andersson headquarters were in our garage!   

**Caring about children and their earth**  

The magic of Hanna Andersson isn't only in the products we make - it's deeply ingrained in giving back to our community. Did you know that a portion of every Hanna purchase goes to help children through donations that support children in need? Our HannaHelps Program continues the company's 20 year tradition of charitable giving by awarding yearly grants to hundreds of schools and nonprofit groups serving children across the nation. It also helps the environment through our offerings of organically grown cotton. Here's to a better future for all children.   

**Best of all, we let kids be kids** From day one, we've let kids be kids. For us that means butter-soft fabrics and energizing colors, comfy shapes that aren't too tight or too grown-up. And maybe best of all - our long-lasting quality is so terrific that little ones don't have to be careful about their clothes! What started as a passion for beautiful quality in children's clothing has grown up into an inspiration that guides the comfort and quality of everything we make.   

Welcome to our world of softness. . .

More than 1,000 teachers paid $6 a year to get 21 days of hospital care. In 1934, the plan got a name and a logo: Blue Cross. A similar plan started for doctors’ services in the lumber and mining camps out west. It became known as Blue Shield."

8299,Google,"**A Googol** \- mathematical term for a 1 followed by 100 zeros. This name was chosen by founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to reflects the immense volume of information that exists, and the scope of Google's mission: to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.  

**Search**  

Search is how Google began, and it's at the heart of what we do today. We devote more engineering time to search than to any other product at Google, because we believe that search can always be improved. We are constantly working to provide you with more relevant results so that you find what you're looking for faster. To that end, we've added services such as personalized search, which tailors results for you if you are signed in to your Google account. You can also find images, videos, maps, patents and much more. With universal search technology, you can often find all of these things combined in one query.  

**Ads**  

As a business, Google generates the majority of its revenue by offering advertisers measurable, cost-effective and highly relevant advertising, so that the ads are useful to the people who see them as well as to the advertisers who run them. Hundreds of thousands of advertisers worldwide use our Google AdWords program to promote their products and services on the web. In addition, hundreds of thousands of partners, from bloggers to major online publishers, participate in our Google AdSense program. This program delivers ads from our AdWords advertisers that are relevant to the content or search results on partner sites. We also offer a number of other services to advertisers, including various advertising formats on YouTube, Google TV Ads, as well as online ad serving and management services through DoubleClick.  

**Apps**   

Today people want the same ease of use on their work computers that they have on their increasingly powerful personal computers. This is why we offer businesses a suite called Google Apps incorporating Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Docs to help people communicate and collaborate more easily. It's powerful enough for large enterprises (we use it across all of Google, in fact) but simple enough for smaller businesses too. We're continually improving Google Apps, so you always have the latest version without worrying about maintenance or upgrades. And it's much less expensive than most traditional software. Google Apps is designed to fit the way people naturally live, work and socialize, so they can focus on what they're doing rather than worrying about maintaining the software.  

**Mobile**  

You should be able to access all of Google's services wherever you are - even if you don't have a computer nearby. We make it easy for you to use your favorite Google products, from Google Maps to YouTube, right from your phone. As mobile devices become increasingly central to people's lives, we work hard to find new and better ways to help you get the information you need when you are on the go."

But one constant has remained: We have an unwavering commitment to uphold our founding ideals to provide industry-leading products and first-rate services to the customers we’re privileged to serve.   

Different Eras, Same Exceptional Service   

Farmers not only prides itself on helping you plan wisely for the unexpected, but also on helping restore order when it occurs, so you can keep moving along the road of your life’s plans.   

In 1959 a Farmers customer wrote us a letter of surprised gratitude when his car battery was replaced just an hour after it was stolen. A letter from a couple in 2002 wrote that their Farmers agent and Claims Adjuster “were exceptional in their handling of our grief, what we needed to do, and helpful in many other ways.” That same year, when Hurricane Rita struck Beaumont, Texas, Farmers sent 300 agents to assess damages while policy holders were evacuated. Farmers also donated $100,000 for the city’s emergency operations center and two megawatt generators that restored power to Beaumont. Whatever year or decade a disaster occurs, you can count on us to be there for you.   

Today, the companies comprising the Farmers Insurance Group of Companies make up one of the country's largest insurers of vehicles, homes and small businesses and provide a wide range of other insurance and financial services products.   

Farmers is proud to serve more than 10 million households with more than 20 million individual policies across all 50 states through the efforts of over 50,000 exclusive and independent agents and nearly 24,000 employees.   

The Farmers Exchanges are three reciprocal insurers (Farmers Insurance Exchange, Fire Insurance Exchange and Truck Insurance Exchange) owned by their policyholders, and together with their subsidiaries and affiliates comprise the Farmers Insurance Group of Companies.

14016,Care.com,"Care is a global need without geographic or demographic boundaries. At some point, every person and every family will have care needs, be it for children, seniors, pets or even homes. Our mission is to improve the lives of families and caregivers by helping them connect in a reliable and easy way. Our solutions help families make informed decisions in one of the most important and highly considered aspects of their family life: finding and managing quality care for their loved ones. In providing families a comprehensive marketplace for care, we are also building the largest global destination for quality caregivers to find fulfilling employment and career opportunities. We strive to help our members - families and caregivers - pursue their passions and fulfill the basic human need of caring for each other.

Founder and CEO Sheila Lirio Marcelo wanted to transform the way families and businesses around the world address their care needs. Care.com launched in the U.S. in 2007 and today, we are the world's largest online marketplace for finding and managing family care, with more than 30.8 million members, spanning over 20 countries.

Care.com's premise is simple: Our consumer matching solutions allow families to search for, qualify, vet, connect with, and ultimately select caregivers in a low-cost, reliable and easy way. Our platform also provides caregivers with solutions to create personal profiles, describe their unique skills and experience, and otherwise differentiate themselves in a highly fragmented marketplace.

We understand that care is an exceptionally personal matter and impacts the most important aspect of families' lives which is why we provide an array of services and resources to help families make safer and more informed hiring decisions. The Care.com Safety Center offers a comprehensive Safety Guide, which details numerous tools, resources and tips to assist families through the search and hiring process. Through third-parties, we also offer three tiers of background checks which vary in comprehensiveness.

Care.com's global footprint began to expand in 2012 when we launched in the UK and Canada, followed by the acquisition of Berlin-based Besser Betreut, the largest online care portal in Europe. In every territory in which we operate, the fundamental service remains the same but is tailored to meet the unique cultural needs of its membership.

As Care.com has grown, so has the scope of the products and services we offer. Our consumer payments solutions enable families to not only electronically pay a caregiver but also subscribe for tax preparation services through our Care.com HomePay product. We have also expanded our marketplace beyond the direct family-to-caregiver interaction. We currently serve employers by providing access to our platform to more than 600,000 employer-sponsored families, and we enable care-related businesses, such as daycare centers, nanny agencies and home care agencies, to market their services to our care-seeking families and recruit our caregiver members."

14248,Stratasys ,"OVERVIEW 

Stratasys Ltd. was formed in 2012 by the merger of Stratasys Inc. and Objet Ltd. We manufacture 3D printers and materials that create prototypes and manufactured goods directly from 3D CAD files or other 3D content. The 3D printers are based on patented FDM® and PolyJet® inkjet-based technologies. 

Stratasys systems are used by manufacturers to create models and prototypes to aid in the new product design process. And they are becoming widely used for production of finished goods in low-volume manufacturing. Systems range from affordable desktop 3D printers to large production systems for direct digital manufacturing. 

The FDM process creates parts by extruding molten thermoplastic in fine layers to build the part layer by layer. The PolyJet process also creates parts by building in layers but employs an ink jet style jetting process to apply photopolymers in fine layers and simultaneously cures them with ultraviolet light. 

Stratasys also manufacturers Solidscape 3D Printers and operates the RedEye On Demand digital manufacturing service. We have over 1000 employees and hold over 500 granted or pending additive manufacturing patents globally. Our range of 120 3D printing materials is the widest in the industry and includes over 100 proprietary inkjet-based photopolymer materials and 10 proprietary FDM-based thermoplastic materials. 

Through our network of certified, value added resellers and distributors, Stratasys delivers responsive, regional support around the globe. Stratasys maintains dual headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Rehovot, Israel. Stratasys is a public company that trades on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol SSYS.

OUR TECHNOLGIES 

Our 3D printing technologies are additive manufacturing at its best.

 **Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM®)**  

Prototypes, tools and production parts made with FDM Technology are tough enough to not only test functionality, but hold up under everyday use. Uniquely, FDM uses real thermoplastics like ABS, polycarbonate and ULTEM 9085. The ability to print in these end-use manufacturing materials is the main reason FDM is a highly sought-after 3D printing technology.

 **PolyJet®**  

3D printing technology builds precise prototypes and concept models that best mimic how a product will look and feel. Only our PolyJet 3D printers can print multiple digital materials in a single build. That means closer simulation of products and a boost in creativity.

 **Drop-On-Demand & Smooth Curvature Printing**  

Most consumer inkjet printers use drop-on-demand technology. Our drop-on-demand 3D printing technology works by depositing up to 12000 droplets per second of a wax-like material onto a build plate in a layer-by-layer fashion to produce wax-like patterns ready for direct casting and other mold making methods of small precision part manufacturing. At 5000 drops-per-inch our proprietary Smooth Curvature Printing (SCP) technology is a jewelry industry favorite. These high precision printers give jewelry designers the freedom to produce creations of the finest feature detail with perfect symmetry and a precise surface finish. 

MISSION & VISION 

3D printing is bringing about the next industrial revolution. And we’re here to lead it. We’re here to help designers perfect their ideas. We’re here to help manufacturers remake the way they make things. We’re here to give individuals, teams and entire organizations 3D printing systems, services and solutions that transform the way they work. 

We see the design process liberated, becoming more iterative and more creative. We see the manufacturing process transformed, becoming more agile and more efficient. We see more communication and collaboration bringing better products to market faster. We see Stratasys 3D Printers in every office, plant, lab and school on earth. 

CULTURE 

Stratasys is the unquestioned leader in 3D printing. We are makers of professional 3D printers and restless innovators, but great technology is only half of the story. We wouldn’t be the market leader without our talented employees. 

We reward initiative and innovation, and encourage employee development.

 **Cooperation** \- We are dedicated to honest communication that creates clear expectations, fostering trust and teamwork.

 **Creativity** \- We value and reward innovative solutions through an open-minded environment that allows us to grow and enhance our business.

 **Commitment** \- We are committed to treating our internal and external customers with respect in a fair working environment while providing high quality, customer-driven solutions."

7842,Huitt-Zollars Inc.,"In an era when all professional service firms looked alike, a desire to create a business culture that made the focus on integrity, quality, and client satisfaction, Huitt-Zollars' founders knew firsthand that when top-notch people work in a quality environment on great projects, everyone wins.

The idea was born from a friendship that began in the late 1960's. While working for the same engineering firm early in their careers, Larry Huitt, a now-retired structural engineer, and Robert Zollars, a civil engineer, became respected colleagues. Although they pursued different career paths, their shared business values and mutual desire to create an unmatched culture soon brought them together.

In establishing the firm in 1975, they committed to a set of operating principles that continue to be the backbone of the company. Today, Huitt-Zollars' core values are inherent in its people, projects, process, and philosophy.

From day one, the company has followed this vision and has grown into one of the most respected firms in the United States. Nineteen offices nationwide, consistent repeat business, a growing portfolio of work and recognition via numerous awards and honors attest to the company's reputation. We continue to earn some of the nation's most challenging projects and attract the best talent.

Huitt-Zollars, we continue to win many of the top projects in the nation. Our growth creates opportunities that could impact your future. **About us:** Nationwide offices and a long-standing history of an award-winning portfolio. **About you:** Possess top A/E/C skills, seek a culture based on quality projects executed with the utmost integrity and are ready for the next step in your career, Huitt-Zollars could be the firm that fits your professional goals and style.  Huitt-Zollars' employees are owners in their own company since we operate as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Quality in the execution and delivery of all projects begins when the right people are hired. Huitt-Zollars selects candidates based on the education, experience, skill set, work ethic and personal values that align with support Huitt-Zollars' mission and core values. 

**MISSION STATEMENT** \- Our commitment is to understand the needs of our clients and to meet those needs by delivering professional services with the highest level of quality and integrity."

15012,Optical Cable Corp.,"**Corporate Overview**  

From the development of our first cables through our current product offering, which ranks among the industry's most comprehensive, Optical Cable Corporation (OCC®) is a company that provides uncompromising product quality and performance, with solutions for a multitude of market applications.  

OCC has earned a reputation as an industry leader, an innovator and a designer of some of the highest-performing cabling and connectivity products available. For years, OCC has been internationally recognized for pioneering the design and production of fiber optic cables. Today, OCC is internationally recognized as a leader in engineering and manufacturing a complete line of top-tier cabling and connectivity solutions, including products and solutions suitable for the most demanding applications.  

**Optical Cable Corporation:**  

**We started by revolutionizing the design of a cable. We evolved to change the way the world communicates.**   

Founded in 1983, OCC was among the first companies to realize the potential of fiber optics through designing and manufacturing some of the most reliable, rugged and innovative cable products in the world. The U.S. Military needed an extremely strong, lightweight, rugged, and survivable fiber optic cable, able to efficiently transmit previously unprecedented volumes of data in the field. OCC and its engineers were at the forefront of the development of the tight-buffered, tight-bound cable technology that met these criteria. The result: cables that were easy to deploy and performed under the harshest of conditions.  

OCC's success in the battlefield provided a foundation for the creation of a broad fiber optic cable offering built on the evolution of our technologies, as well as opportunities to expand our product offerings beyond fiber optic cabling.  

OCC has evolved into a world-class provider of a complete line of fiber optic and copper cabling and connectivity products to a broad customer base. While out heritage started with military, our expertise now extends in to the enterprise, broadcast, industrial, harsh environment, and various specialty markets, and reaches worldwide through our network of distributors with customers in more than 70 countries.  

The acquisition of two industry leaders enables OCC to easily transition from a leading provider of fiber optic cables to a company offering a complete integrated suite of cabling and connectivity solutions.  

Located just outside of Asheville, our North Carolina facility manufactures products using innovative and patented technologies, offering our customers a full range of fiber optic and copper data communication connectivity products. OCC engineers at this facility actively develop products not only to enhance connectivity and networking, but also to establish test and measurement standards for the entire communications industry.  

Our Dallas, Texas facility provides OCC with innovative expertise and the capability to manufacture specialty fiber optic connectors and connectivity solutions of military and harsh environment applications. OCC's groundbreaking innovations in hardened connectors have become the standard for field tactical military communications, stadium broadcasts, and critical mining applications.  

By expanding our capabilities and product offerings, we have strategically positioned OCC to support our customers' need for increasingly sophisticated communications infrastructure and end-to-end cabling and connectivity solutions. Before being acquired by OCC, each new facility was a world-class technology leader in its own right. Now, together as Optical Cable Corporation, we have become a total cabling and connectivity solutions provider for our customers.

""I have worked for EBI for 7 years. I am grateful to be part of an organization that shares my values on respecting the humanity of not only the wonderful community we serve, but also the humanity of those who serve. I am fulfilled as what I give is generously received by my clients and my fellow workers.""

- Nini Schouborg, SLS Community Living Assistant

""East Bay Innovations has become like a second family, always willing and ready to assist, instruct, and educate its employees. I have grown tremendously in the field of social work over the last two years and credit my advancements to the ongoing education and guidance we receive at East Bay Innovations.""

- Melissa Martinez, ILS Specialist

""Apart from the rewarding friendships I have formed with clients and co-workers this past year, my experiences in this position have been tremendously valuable during the medical school application cycle. In every medical school interview, people were interested in my work in the day program. The job gave me a unique perspective on healthcare as it pertains to disabled adults.

I think I am more comfortable around patients' bodies than many of my peers, and I am grateful that as a future healthcare provider I'll have awareness of disability rights and familiarity with the complex medical needs of a diverse patient base.

Working in a program like CDS would be great for people thinking about a career in medicine, physical therapy, or nursing, or who are interested in adaptive communication, adaptive sports, or disability rights activism. I cannot overstate how lucky I feel to have been a part of the CDS team!""

As customers increasingly asked Lofgren and Schmick to stock oxygen and acetylene to aid in their own welding jobs, the partners saw a tremendous opportunity. United States Welding Works Company was formed as a supply house for atmospheric gases and welding supplies. The company continued to grow prior to and during World War II.

### 1947

The founders sold the company to the sons of Charles Lofgren, Robert Lofgren Sr. and Walter Lofgren. The operation had grown to include routes over the entire state of Colorado, western Kansas and Nebraska, with a branch in Casper, Wyoming.

### 1954

Robert Sr. suffered a stroke and his son Robert Jr. immediately took over management of the company and remained the CEO until 2000. Under Robert Lofgren Jr.'s tenure, the company accomplished significant growth. He used the momentum started by the founders of the company and the growth of the nation as a whole to propel United States Welding Works forward with new stores and a new name, United States Welding, Inc.

### 2000

The company again changed hands but remained in the Lofgren family when Rick and Kathy Lofgren bought the company from Robert and Barbara Lofgren. Kathy and Rick met in graduate school while both pursuing MBA's. Kathy spent the first part of her professional career negotiating land deals for oil and gas drilling while Rick honed his vision for our future while learning every aspect of the atmospheric gas business. Together they bring many years of business expertise to the company and a diversified skill set with complementary knowledge and experience.

From cybersecurity and data analytics to strategic consulting and cloud services, the XOR team provides the insight, expertise and dedication to ensure mission success. Our solutions deliver certainty – the certainty you need to make critical decisions and lead with confidence.

Through this, our clients gain a deeper understanding of health and risks to their enterprise, and of their adversary’s tools, techniques and processes. Better information, clearly presented, leads to better decisions.

  *   

One root, written into the [school's founding documents](http://www.rpi.edu/about/history.html ""History""), is the application of science to the common purposes of life. This kept the focus on engineering solutions to national and international needs and challenges. [Rensselaer graduates](http://www.rpi.edu/about/alumni/index.html ""Rensselaer graduates"") constructed the canals, roads, bridges, skyscrapers, and basic infrastructure of America, which helped to form the basis for 20th century society.   

  * The second root, also built into the school's origin, was the employment of unique educational strategies. In the earliest days, after initial instruction, students taught what they knew to each other since teaching reinforces learning. Likewise, students performed scientific experiments rather than watch faculty conduct them, as had been the common practice.

_The Rensselaer Plan 2024_   

Armed with our intellects, our energy, and a bold vision for the future, we launched a process to realize the mission of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in new and tangible ways. We conceived and implemented [   

_The Rensselaer Plan_   

](http://www.rpi.edu/president/plan/index.html ""Summary""), to bring new meaning, and new substance, to the question we ask ourselves as the first technological university in the nation: Why not change the world?   

We began our journey of transformation where necessity demanded. We have made major investments in our people, programs, platforms, and partnerships; and, together, we have brought about a true Renaissance at Rensselaer. These investments have enabled us to transform Rensselaer into a top-tier technological research university with global reach and global impact. That transformation serves as a solid foundation on which we will build even greater achievements in the future.

Our journey of transformation continues, under [   

_The Rensselaer Plan 2024_   

](http://www.rpi.edu/plan/summary.html ""Summary""). In the same spirit as its precursor, the revised Plan is evergreen, prepared to grow and evolve, as the Institute grows and evolves. In advancing _The Rensselaer Plan 2024_ , we are moving from transforming Rensselaer to Rensselaer being transformative: transformative in our students' lives; transformative in our innovative pedagogy, nationally and internationally; transformative in the global impact of our research."

Perpetuating a fulfilling, challenging and safe work environment that encourages continuous improvement, provides equal opportunity, offers economic satisfaction through the recognition and rewarding of achievement, and ensures we maintain a healthy respect for our competitors, customers, suppliers and fellow employees in a clean and safe work environment.   

**Ethics**  

Conducting our affairs and nurturing our relationships with customers, suppliers, co-workers, mutual interest groups and others in a forthright and ethical manner.

Benefits [Click to learn more](http://www.leprinofoods.com/careers/benefits. )   

Our Story Behind the superior quality and performance of our cheese lies the legacy of a man with a vision - to make the finest mozzarella cheese available anywhere.  

Mike Leprino, Sr. arrived in America in 1914 with little more than fierce determination and a tough set of principles. In 1950 with the help of his family, Mike Leprino began making small batches of ricotta and mozzarella cheese for delivery to local grocery stores. An uncompromising commitment to product quality and customer service fueled demand for Leprino cheese.  

Today the company he founded is the world's largest producer of mozzarella cheese and remains singularly focused upon making the finest cheese and whey products.   

Results Through People   

**Environment**  

Our employees perform their best and feel considerable pride because they are active contributors to the continued success of the largest mozzarella maker in the world - and especially to the continued success of our customers. Employee teams propose and implement ideas to improve our products, service and technology, and track their success. In fact, our employees frequently surpass their own records when it comes to safety standards and innovative processes.   

**Culture**  

The culture of Leprino Foods Company is one of hard work, striving for excellence, high expectations and pride. To be successful requires high energy and passion, with a desire to take on challenges and do what it takes to keep Leprino Foods at the top of its industry. The hard work encountered here proves to be worthwhile when considering that we work for a market leader with great financial security and long-term stability. We are extremely committed to quality and to customer service.   

At Leprino Foods, we believe:   

  * Exceptional customer service is the attitude of caring among all our employees that motivates them to go beyond traditional boundaries in order to facilitate the realization of our Vision. 

  * Exceptional customer service involves serving others as each of us would like to be served. 

  * Exceptional customer service must be pro-active, not reactive. It means anticipating a customer’s needs. 

  * Exceptional customer service is not limited to external customers, it must also be extended to our internal customers, to fellow employees, to our suppliers, and to all other business contacts. 

  * Exceptional customer service takes everyone’s efforts. One employee with a lack of effort can create poor customer service. 

  * Exceptional customer service is fundamental to achieving our Vision. It is not a vision in and of itself.

**Growth Opportunities and Leadership Development**  

Employees of Leprino Foods Company will agree that most positions and departments offer a high level of growth to the employees. This comes from both promotional advancement and personal growth opportunities. In addition, we offer an extensive list of training opportunities to all levels of employees. This can range from PC training and operator training all the way to leadership training and ways to further develop the competencies possessed by successful leaders.  

**Mission and Philosophies**  

Our mission and philosophy at Leprino Foods is to establish, through our actions, an unparalleled standard of excellence in people, products, and service while increasing our market share and perpetuating a healthy company that appropriately rewards all our efforts and investments. We believe that the health and longevity of our company can best be achieved through an uncompromising commitment by all of us to Leprino Quality as a way of life. Leprino Quality is exemplified by an attitude of continuous improvement in each of the following areas:  

  * Product Quality: Operating our facilities in a neat, clean, orderly, and well-maintained fashion while producing distinctively superior quality cheese and whey products that add value to our customers’ businesses. 

  * Customer Service: Perpetuating a proactive customer-centered attitude among all of us, which produces distinguished service in every aspect of our internal and external customer relationships. 

  * Leadership and Innovation: Breaking traditional barriers and constantly expanding the horizons of our industry through bold leadership in product and process technology which continues to create new standards of excellence in product value. 

  * People: Perpetuating a fulfilling and safe work environment that: 

  * Values the importance of clean, organized, and well-maintained facilities, 

  * Encourages the involvement of everyone in the business problem-solving, decision-making process, while not tolerating Company politics, 

  * Fosters a willingness to innovate and stretch personal and collective boundaries, 

  * Provides equal opportunity for personal and leadership development,

  * Promotes company pride though an unselfish, teamwork-driven attitude among all of us, 

  * Offers economic satisfaction through the recognition and rewarding of individual and collective contributions, and 

  * Maintains a focus on safety in all aspects of our business.

  * Ethics: Conducting our affairs and nurturing our relationships with customers, suppliers, co-workers, mutual interest groups and others in a forthright and ethical manner. 

  * Citizenship: Recognizing our responsibilities toward, and encouraging involvement in, the communities of which we are a part, while respecting individual freedom of choice, and maintaining the highest standard of environmental and regulatory compliance.

**Teamwork**  

As an employee of Leprino Foods, you will have a chance to make a difference by joining one of the many Leprino Employee Involvement Teams and Task Forces.  

We all benefit from these teams by having employees bring better problem solving, new ideas, and efficiencies to the Company. Team members benefit personally as well. Through involvement in one or more of these teams, members enhance their knowledge of Leprino’s operations and get the opportunity to work with people outside their normal contacts, doing tasks outside their normal scope of work. Team members also learn basic tools to help identify and work through problems – tools that will help them every day in their job and their personal life.   

**Community Involvement**  

Each of our locations has employees active in the communities they work and reside in. Leprino Foods is involved either by sponsorship, participating in, or donating to many worthwhile events.

He moved to San Diego in 1970 where his wife worked as a secretary and Tom got into San Diego City College. Tom worked to get into UCSD to earn his Bachelor's degree. In order to support his family after his first son was born, Tom worked as a research technician at Mercy hospital and a Lab Manager at the VA hospital. He discovered that there were no commercial suppliers of antibodies. Tom decided to measure what to date had not been measured - hormones with the use of antibodies. If he could make a go of his business of making goat antibodies , he would work to fulfill his original goal of helping people."

17083,Goya Foods Inc,"""Founded in 1936, Goya Foods, Inc. is America’s largest Hispanic-owned food company and the premier source for authentic Latin cuisine. Combined with authentic ingredients, robust seasonings and convenient preparation, Goya provides consumers with over 2,200 high-quality and affordable food products from the Caribbean, Mexico, Spain, Central and South America.   

Goya has fostered a longstanding history not only in the food industry, but also as a cultural symbol beginning in New York more than 78 years ago. The company’s commitment to excellence is the cornerstone of Goya’s popular credo, “If it’s Goya, it has to be good”. The result of this simple, yet deeply resonant pledge is the evolution of Goya Foods as a leader in the Latin American food industry and a trusted American brand.   

The history and story of Goya is as much about the importance of family and values as it is about achieving the American dream and helping to cultivate the Latin culture in the United States. In 1936, Don Prudencio Unanue and his wife Carolina, immigrants who first migrated to Puerto Rico from Spain, started Goya in a small storefront on Duane Street in Lower Manhattan. Driven by the belief that there was a growing consumer market for high-quality, fresh-tasting, Latin foods, the Unanues catered to local Hispanic families by distributing authentic Spanish products including olives, olive oil and sardines.   

As the Hispanic population grew in New York and throughout the United States, Goya’s product line and facilities expanded as well. The company relocated from Lower Manhattan to Brooklyn in 1958, until it established its current headquarters in Secaucus, New Jersey in 1974. In 2014, Goya announced a $250,000 million global expansion of four new state of the art manufacturing and distribution centers in Texas, California, Georgia and New Jersey to meet the consumer demands of healthy Goya products. In total, the company now boasts 16 facilities throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Spain, employs over 4,000 worldwide, and produces and distributes over 2,200 products including condiments, pantry items, beverages, canned and frozen, as well as a vast assortment of low sodium, gluten-free, organic, and kosher foods.   

To further its consumer reach, Goya has revamped and expanded its online presence including the launch of interactive social media campaigns through Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and YouTube. While sharing great-tasting, authentic Latin recipes for family home cooking, Goya strives to personalize the consumer experience as well as educate Hispanics and non-Hispanics alike to the diversity of Latin American cuisine and cooking techniques. Visitors to Goya on-line are encouraged to become part of La Gran Familia Goya by receiving Goya e-News, a quarterly electronic newsletter full of timely recipes, new product announcements and fun prizes. The Goya eStore makes a variety of Caribbean, Mexican, South and Central American products including rice, beans, olives and a variety of condiments available to consumers online within mainland United States.   

Intent on preserving its rich cultural heritage, Goya celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2011, a milestone achievement that was recognized through a national, yearlong celebration while launching new company campaigns and initiatives. During Hispanic Heritage Month, President Barack Obama honored Goya for its continued success and commitment to the Hispanic community, the only company to ever be honored by The President. The following year, Goya collaborated with First Lady Michelle Obama and the USDA to launch MyPlate/ MiPlato campaign, a national health initiative to help educate Americans on how to eat healthy.   

In addition, Goya Foods has been a proud supporter of programs, scholarships and activities that benefit families and children throughout the world. Each year, Goya actively engages with social, civic and local food banks on charitable endeavors that promote and sustain community wellness and the advancement of the Hispanic culture. The company has also taken the lead in numerous disaster relief efforts, providing food donations in times of crisis and consistently working with local charities and non-profits to assist those less fortunate. Over the years, Goya has donated millions of pounds of food to victims of various disasters and charities worldwide including Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Isaac and Irene, the earthquake in Haiti, The United Way, Maestro Cares, and City Harvest.   

Goya Foods remains firm in its goal of being the brand of choice for authentic Latin cuisine while retaining its family-oriented approach to its consumers and its roots in the culinary traditions of Hispanic communities throughout the world."""

17649,Patricio Enterprises, Inc,"Incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia, Patricio Enterprises (PE) began operations in 2005 after the retirement of its founder and President LtCol Gabe Patricio, United States Marine Corps (Ret). After serving his last two tours on active duty as an Acquisition Officer with the Marine Corps Systems Command, first as a project officer and then as a Program Manager the transition to entrepreneurship within the Defense Industry seemed a natural fit. His vision, to provide innovative business solutions through streamlined cost effective methods that add value and help clients succeed became more than a bumper sticker and is in fact at the heart of the business model. PE became a Small Business Administration 8(a) certified participant in June 2005, and was verified a Service-Disabled, Veteran Owned Small Business by the [Center for Veterans Enterprise](http://www.vetbiz.gov/) (CVE) in July 2009.  

PE's first work was in support of PEO Soldier and JPEO Chemical and Biological Defense. Building on its reputation and client focus, PE expanded operations to Albany, GA in support of the Marine Corps Logistics Command in 2006. PE also began supporting the following programs in Northern VA: PM Infantry Combat Equipment (PM ICE), PM Infantry Weapons Systems (PM IWS), PM Counter RCEID Electronic Warfare (PM CREW) and Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC).  

Concurrently, PE began investing in training, education, tools and infrastructure necessary to support our vision. Among our first investments was training our analysts on ACEIT (Automated Cost Estimating Integrated Tools) and Think Tank®. ACEIT is a very robust cost estimation application and Think Tank® supports unbiased program decision support. It is a web-based team space for brainstorming and a decision-making tool used to evaluate products in an agnostic decision-making environment.  

In 2007, PE teamed with Kalman & Company to continue supporting PM ICE at Marine Corps Systems Command.  

With continued growth came the need to open an office to serve as its headquarters and in June 2008 PE moved its operations to its new headquarters located at 125 Woodstream Boulevard, Suite 105, Stafford, VA. In addition to its headquarters, PE also established an office in Albany, GA and began operations in Dayton, OH after award of a contract in support of the Air Force Uniform Office at Wright-Patterson AFB. Other significant awards made to PE during 2008 included support to the Joint Program Manager Marine Expeditionary Rifle Squad (JPM MERS) and PM ICE on Subject Matter Expertise activities.  

In 2009, PE began supporting PM ICE Rapid Response Issue Facility (RRIF) warehouse operations in Quantico, VA and Barstow, CA. PE was awarded a Program Management, Administrative, Clerical and Technical Services (Pacts) contract under Functional Category 2 - Administrative Services for the Department of Homeland Security, an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract in August. PE was also awarded a prime contract to support Services Branch (LFS), Facilities and Services Division (LF) and Installations and Logistics Department (I&L) at Headquarters, U. S. Marine Corps  

PE surpassed 100 active employees in late March 2010. PE expanded to Newport News, VA; Camp Lejeune, NC; Camp Pendleton, CA; Miramar, CA; Hawaii; and Okinawa, Japan with the recent award of a subcontract in support of Medical Logistics Company (MEDLOGCO)."

We’re building something people use every day. From how you get home from work, to how you eat meals, or how you move huge shipments of absolutely anything, the work we contribute moves the world a few steps forward. And that’s one of the best parts about working here—knowing that the work you do helps shape the future.

And getting to that bright future means solving some of the most difficult problems of the present. It takes a lot of hard work, a lot of love, and support from colleagues all over the world. At Uber, we have brought together a world-class collective of problem-solvers. And we all fundamentally understand that tough challenges help us personally grow the most.

Founded in 1875, David C Cook is a leading nonprofit discipleship resource provider based in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  For more than 140 years, David C Cook has served the Global Church with life transforming materials from best-selling books and curriculum, to toys and games and small group resources.  With additional offices in Elgin, Illinois and Eastbourne, UK, David C Cook is a global organization whose resources are published in more than 150 languages, distributed in more than 170 countries, and sold worldwide through retail stores, catalogs, and online. 

 **Our Mission**

David C Cook is a nonprofit organization dedicated to publishing and distributing leadership and discipleship resources to help Christians all over the world grow in their faith and pass it on to the next generation.  We call this ""DiscipleShaping"".  We were established in 1875 by David Caleb Cook in Chicago, IL.  Since that time, we have published numerous bestselling books from The Picture Bible to Crazy Love by Francis Chan, developed over ten lines of Sunday school curriculum, and published many of today's most popular praise and worship songs through our music division, Integrity Music.

As a ministry, we do more than just publish and distribute Christian resources.  We partner with indigenous organizations to equip Pastors, Lay Leaders, and Sunday School Teachers with our materials in places like India, China, and Cuba. In some places (underdeveloped countries), we make them available at no charge. In others, (developing countries), we subsidize the cost to make them more affordable.

 **Core Values**

 **Truth -**  ""Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Him who is the Head, that is, Christ.""    **_Ephesians 4:15_**

 **Love -  **""By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.""  **_John 13:35_**

 **Integrity -**  ""For we are taking pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of men.""  **_II Corinthians 8:21_**

 **Cooperation -  **""Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed.""  _**Proverbs 15:22**_

 **Accountability -  **""Nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account.""  **_Hebrews 4:13_**

 **Excellence  **- ""Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters.""  _**Colossians 3:23**_

 **Innovation -  **""In every way make the teaching about God our Savior attractive."" _ **  Titus 2:10b**_"

Our Board of Directors is member-elected, and they selflessly serve without pay to help oversee all credit union operations.

As a not-for-profit credit union, we help you rid yourself of the typical bank hassles, fees and surprises.  That means you'll enjoy lower interest rates on loans, higher rates on savings and investment accounts, low or no-fee accounts and more personal care. It's your money -- keep more of it to do more of what you want. That's what we stand for at Stanford FCU."

At POET, we are changing the world for the better while leaving a legacy that promotes health and sustainability through renewable biofuels.

We believe in creativity from common sense. We believe the solution to our nation's growing energy crises is not some far-flung work of science fiction. It's the domestic energy we're producing today. The people of POET are currently replacing millions of barrels of imported oil every year with clean, renewable energy. All while pumping billions of dollars back into the American economy.

In our three decades on the job, POET has developed an unmatched record in technology, reliability and efficiency. That's a legacy we intend to pass on. And every day we keep building on it. Today, we have a network of 28 plants in seven states and produce more than 1.7 billion gallons of biofuels annually.

More important than volume is the efficiency with which we produce our products. POET provides turnkey development, design, engineering, construction, management and marketing services for our plant network. Our facilities are the most successful and profitable in the industry.

Our technologies were developed and refined through years of hard work and collaboration with leaders in clean technology, biochemistry and animal nutrition. As a result, we reap more value from a bushel of corn than anyone.

In addition to biofuels, we've perfected the leading brand of premium dried distillers grains with solubles on the market, Dakota Gold®."

19160,California Pizza Kitchen,"We opened our first restaurant In Beverly Hills in 1985. Former federal prosecutors Rick Rosenfield and Larry Flax combined their passion for food with fresh high-quality ingredients to create innovative, hearth-baked pizzas such as The Original BBQ Chicken, Thai Chicken, and Jamaican Jerk Chicken, cooked in an open kitchen. The restaurant gave California a place in the pizza pantheon alongside Chicago and New York. Our California twist on global flavors resonated with guests, and almost immediately, CPK became a bustling spot for business and family gatherings.

Almost immediately after the first location opened, we expanded from California to more than 250 locations in more than 30 states and 11 countries. But it doesn't stop there; you'll also find us bringing smiles to the pizza aisle in your grocer's freezer, taking the edge off travel fatigue in major airports all over the world, feeding eager fans at sports stadiums and students on college campuses.

California Pizza Kitchen completed an initial public offering in August 2000 and traded on the NASDAQ National Market under the ticker symbol CPKI. On July 7, 2011, Golden Gate Capital completed the acquisition of CPK and as a result of the acquisition, the company’s common stock is no longer publicly traded.

On August 18, 2011, G.J. Hart was named President, Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman."

Our intimate knowledge of our clients includes an understanding of their company culture, management style and future business plans. This not only allows a prospective applicant to make an informed decision before accepting an interview, it gives them the insight required to interview effectively. This ""competitive advantage"" really can make a difference!

Our direct access and relationships with decision makers at our clients allows us to circumvent the ""resume screen"" that often disqualifies a candidate before the interviewing even starts.

We often represent opportunities simply unavailable from other resources. With our understanding of our client company's business needs, we often can create opportunities that don't currently exist by leveraging your background and our reputation into an initial meeting between you and a decision maker at our client."

20593,Montclair,"The history of Montclair is as rich as that of any other West Valley city. The earliest inhabitants of the land that is now Montclair were the Serrano Indians. The Serrano Indians built their village on the banks of a sycamore tree-lined creek which followed what is now Mills Avenue. In 1774, Captain Juan Bautista D'Anza, on his historic trip to the San Gabriel Mission, named that stream ""Arroyo de los Alisos,"" the Stream of the Sycamores. Legend has it that D'Anza carved the initials, ""IHS"" on a large sycamore, which may have been uprooted when the stream, now known as San Antonio Creek, overflowed its banks in 1894.   

Until the 1890s Montclair was little more than grazing land and a watering hole, but in 1897, Mrs. Edward Fraser was instrumental in founding ""The Township of Marquette,"" the area's first modern name. This signaled the beginning of land development which would slowly turn this area into a viable community."

Our overall goal and purpose at Fusion is to improve the lives of everyone we touch, whether through our travelers or our internal employees. We continue to seek out the best talent in the healthcare industry. These travelers provide the hands that may help you heal or even save your life someday, and they will continue to fill our facilities nationwide to nurture each patient in their care. ""We're Picky"" and ""Stop Looking"" are our two biggest taglines; this is because we are not placing just anybody in any job. We are very selective of our travelers to make sure we have the best jobs to keep them happy.  

We commit to placing our travelers on ideal assignments. When you put your trust in us, we will show you how our team can expand your career to the next level. We care about your personal success.

21140,The Rockefeller University,"Founded by John D. Rockefeller, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research was incorporated on June 14, 1901. It was the first institution in the United States devoted solely to biomedical research--to understanding the underlying causes of disease.

Today, renamed Rockefeller University, it is one of the foremost research centers in the world, contributing to 23 Nobel Prizes as well as numerous other awards.

**Rockefeller University Community**

  * 71 heads of laboratories 

  * 200 research and clinical scientists 

  * 350 postdoctoral investigators 

  * 1,050 support staff 

  * 150 Ph.D. students 

  * 50 M.D.-Ph.D. students 

  * 887 alumni

**Areas of basic interdisciplinary research**  

  * biochemistry, structural biology and chemistry

  * molecular, cell and developmental biology 

  * immunology, virology and microbiology 

  * medical sciences and human genetics 

  * neuroscience 

  * physics and mathematical biology

 **Revolutionary accomplishments**  

Rockefeller University researchers achieved many of the last century's seminal advances in the biomedical sciences, including: 

  * Discovering that DNA is the basic material of heredity (1944) 

  * Determining that cancer can be caused by a virus (1911) 

  * Confirming the connection between cholesterol and heart disease (1950s) 

  * Developing methadone maintenance for people addicted to heroin (1960s) 

  * Developing the AIDS ""cocktail"" drug therapy (1990s)

**Seventy-four laboratories form the university's core**   

The university's laboratory-based organizational structure ""without walls"" and pared-down layers of administration do away with the schools and academic departments that too often separate scientists. ""This approach fosters a tremendously rich soup of interdisciplinary research and collaboration,"" says Rockefeller professor and Nobel laureate Günter Blobel. 

**Acclaimed scientists**  

In its history, Rockefeller has been associated with 23 Nobel laureates and 19 Lasker Award recipients. Five faculty members have been named MacArthur Fellows and 12 have garnered the National Medal of Science, the highest science award given by the United States. And, 33 Rockefeller faculty are elected members of the National Academy of Sciences. 

**Partnerships with other leading institutions**  

Rockefeller has close ties with neighboring Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Additional academic partnerships with the Courant Institute of New York University and Bard College provide students with a rich array of training opportunities. Rockefeller forges collaborations with biotech and pharmaceutical companies as needed to speed research findings into development to improve patient care.

 **Clinical research hospital**   

In 1910, Rockefeller scientists founded the nation's first hospital devoted exclusively to experimental medicine. The Rockefeller University Hospital's only patients are participants in clinical trials building on basic research findings from Rockefeller labs. This ""allows the university to maintain an unbroken spectrum of research, from basic to clinical,"" says Joshua Lederberg, Nobel laureate and Rockefeller president emeritus. Unburdened by constraints of standard patient care, the hospital is a vital component of Rockefeller's commitment to accelerating basic research findings on their route from bench to bedside for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. Studies are under way on AIDS/ HIV, obesity, hepatitis C and addictive diseases. 

**More than science**   

Artistic and intellectual activity flourishes on Rockefeller's campus. The verdant grounds, situated on Manhattan's Upper East Side, boast a world-class art collection. The university regularly hosts events designed to explore the intuitive connection between science and the arts.Weekly and monthly recital series grace the university's spectacular auditorium, and a variety of exhibits regularly take shape on campus -currently including sculpture on temporary exhibition from New York's Museum of Modern Art. 

**Select graduate student body**   

A class of Ph.D. and M.D.-Ph.D. students from across the United States and the world works closely with international faculty in a rigorous, highly personalized program of graduate study and research. The university offers graduate students access and opportunities to work with leading scientists, as well as full financial support and affordable on- and off-campus housing.

**University budget**   

Funding the research studies of The Rockefeller University's scientists are the National Institutes of Health and other government agencies, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, private gifts and endowment income."

21229,County of York ,"Yorktown is most remembered as the site where Lord Cornwallis surrendered to General George Washington, effectively ending the American Revolutionary War. But even before the struggle for independence, the town was a bustling and prosperous 18th century seaport, having been established by the 1691 Act of Ports. Yorktown also witnessed major Civil War activity. Its fortifications held off a Union army attack during the Peninsula Campaign of 1862.

Today, York County is home to about 65,000 residents. York County is located in southeastern Virginia on the York River and is part of the Historic Triangle, which includes Jamestown, Williamsburg and Yorktown. For over 375 years, it has been a desirable place to visit, live, and work. The County has great natural beauty, one of the top-rated public school systems in Virginia, excellent recreational and social opportunities, low crime rates, a strong dedicated workforce, abundant green space, a mild climate, and an overall outstanding quality of life."

More than 150 continuous years of service later, that business is known as Hajoca Corporation. Hajoca has a robust history of helping to shape advances in plumbing. But we attribute our success to two simple truths - a unique business philosophy and talented people.

### If we seem big, please take a closer look. Our roots run very deep.

Hajoca blends the clout of a large company with the opportunity of a small one. We understand that tastes and styles are different from place to place, so a ""one size fits all"" approach does not work. Our businesses have the freedom to operate like any local company and our managers conduct themselves with the focus and passion of business owners, right down to the products they carry and the people they hire.

**Entrepreneurs welcome...and sought.**   

Good customer service means quality of work; exceptional customer service means quality of people. Members of our team are enthusiastic, driven to excel and singly steadfast in their commitment to service, integrity and reliability. They're also your neighbors and friends. They understand your unique needs because they've lived in your community for years."

21895,General Dynamics Bath Iron Works,"Shipbuilding has been a way of life along the Kennebec River in Bath, Maine, since 1762, when the sailing ship _Earl of Bute_ was launched on the site of present day Bath. The Bath Iron Works (BIW) shipyard, located on the west bank of the Kennebec, just south of downtown Bath, is the namesake of an iron foundry established in 1826.   

Brevet General Thomas W. Hyde, US Army (Ret) took over the foundry in 1865, following service with the 20th Maine Regiment during the Civil War. Nearly two decades later, he incorporated his diversified marine business interests as Bath Iron Works, Limited in 1884, before expanding into shipbuilding with the acquisition of the Goss Marine Iron Works in 1888.The first BIW-built vessel was a coastal passenger ship named Cottage City built for the Maine Steamship Co. Since the completion of Hull #1 in 1890, BIW has been awarded more than 425 shipbuilding contracts, including 245 military ships (mostly destroyers and frigates for the US Navy) and over 160 private yachts and commercial vessels. BIW became a wholly-owned subsidiary of General Dynamics in September 1995.   

In terms of modern US Navy surface combatant programs -- ones where BIW ships are still in service -- the Lead Ship construction contract for the _Oliver Hazard Perry_ (FFG 7) Class of guided missile frigates was awarded to BIW in 1973, and 24 of these surface combatants were delivered over the next 15 years.   

In 1982, the Navy selected BIW as second-source shipbuilder for the _Ticonderoga_ (CG 47) Class of AEGIS guided missile cruisers. The company went on to win contracts for eight of these warships, delivering the final one in 1993. In 1985 BIW won the competition for detail design and construction of USS _Arleigh Burke_ (DDG 51) , the Lead Ship for the Navy's newest, most capable class of AEGIS guided missile destroyers. BIW has delivered the lead ship and 30 follow ships, with delivery of the final follow ship under the most recent contract expected in 2011. The US Navy has announced that it will acquire further _Arleigh Burke_ class vessels during the next decade.   

Under General Dynamics' ownership, BIW solidified its industry leadership position by teaming with the City of Bath and the State of Maine to support a long-term capital investment plan. With the first phase of modernization completed in 2001, BIW began building ships in its new state-of-the-art facility. These improvements ($320 million so far) enable the company to offer unprecedented productivity, quality and affordability to our customer. Further applications of lean manufacturing techniques and advanced modular construction are planned, and the yard has switched to 3D computer-aided design for its latest ships. BIW is building the first of the DDG 1000 class of destroyers, _Zumwalt_ , using these advanced technologies.   

BIW is a yard with a history, and a bright future. Throughout Navy circles - and especially with their current and former crews - it's generally recognized that **'Bath Built Is Best Built'** a phrase first heard in the early 1900s, and every bit as true today as when it was first said."

This company, which is now known in Japan as Yamaha Corporation, currently manufactures pianos, electronic organs, keyboards, band instruments, audio components, tennis rackets and archery products in the United States. In 1955, Yamaha Corporation formed Yamaha Motor C., Ltd. (YMC) for the purpose of manufacturing motorcycles. Their first model was powered by a simple two-stroke engine and was designated the YA-1. In the years that followed, YMC devoted considerable energy and resources to the advancement of gasoline engine technology. Those efforts were so successful that today YMC is recognized as a world leader in the design and manufacture of gasoline engines. YMC currently manufactures state-of-the-art high performance engines for the Ford Taurus SHO, as well as the Toyota Celica, Supra and Camry models. However, YMC is best known for it's motorcycles and Yamaha engines that power the many other products it developed, which, along with the development of it's engine capability YMC also developed an expertise in fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP). This was a forerunner of more advanced plastics material technology currently used in many of it's products, including our golf cars and water vehicles. Yamaha Motor Manufacturing Corporation (YMMC) was formed in 1986. YMMC is the first manufacturing operation that YMC has established in a highly developed country. We manufacture Golf cars, ATV's, Water Vehicles and Side by Side utility vehicles. The enviable worldwide reputation that Yamaha has earned is a result of the quality, reliability and performance built into each of it's products. These values are a long-established tradition and are a direct result of the dedication and skill of Yamaha's employees."

6017,GOOCH & HOUSEGO,"**G &H was founded G&H in Ilminster, Somerset in 1948. The core skills at the time were centered on manufacturing scientific optical components and crystalline materials. These skills are still very much at the cornerstone of the current operations at Ilminster with global sales of acousto-optics, crystal optics and precision optics. The company now works as a supply chain partner in aerospace & defence, industrial, life science and scientific research sectors providing systems and components based on a broad range of photonic technologies.**

**From its origins as a craft-based optical engineering company rich in practical optical manufacturing skills, G &H has undergone a transformation over the last twenty years into a high-technology photonics business through an acquisition policy of the best-in-breed companies in individual technology areas . The company now has manufacturing sites in the US in California, New Hampshire, Maryland, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Virginia, in addition to its three UK facilities located in Ashford, Ilminster, Glenrothes, St Asaph, and Torquay, and Shanghai, China.**

**In 1997 G &H was admitted to the alternative investment market (AIM) on the London Stock Exchange. Today the company comprises eight manufacturing sites, with sales offices in France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore with additional representation by a global  network of distributors.**

**We have three core business:**

 **AEROSPACE AND DEFENCE,  ** **INDUSTRIAL & TELECOM,  ** **LIFE SCIENCES, AND BIOPHOTONICS with our e** **xpertise centering on the four technologies:**

 **ACOUSTO-OPTICS -  **Vertically integrated acousto-optics (AO) manufacturing begins with the growth of lithium niobate (LiNbO3) and tellurium dioxide (TeO2) crystals used in AO devices. We orientate, cut, shape and polish crystals before they can be coated. Transducers are wire bonded and devices are packaged. We design drivers suitable for each product range.

![Acousto-Optic Capabilities](https://gandh.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Acousto-Optics-Capabilities.webp)

 **ELECTRO-OPTICS -  **Our electro-optics (EO) manufacturing is also integrated. We grow our own crystal: Beta barium borate (BBO), Cadmium sulfide (CdS), Cadmium selenide (CdSe), Potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP), Potassium dideuterium phosphate (KD*P) and Tellurium dioxide (TeO2). Each material has different optical properties and we design and manufacture EO Pockel cells for a range of applications based on these. We also design and manufacture drivers to control and optimize Pockel cell performance for advanced laser systems.

![Electro-Optic Capabilities](https://gandh.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Electro-Optic-Capabilities.webp)

 **FIBER OPTICS -  **We are renowned for our active and passive components and photonic modules. We are able to provide high performance space- and Telcordia-qualified products for use in all-fiber systems. Our expertise encompasses challenging areas such as manufacturing HI-REL fused components for under-sea and space deployment, working with challenging materials such as PCF or chalcogenide, and designing and testing low SWaP modules for use in rugged environments.

![Fiber Optic Capabilities](https://gandh.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Fiber-Optic-Capabilities.webp)

 **PRECISION OPTICS -  **We design and manufacture precision optics components and assemblies that few other companies can. Our planar, aspheric, prism and waveplate products are globally acclaimed. G&H precision PO capabilities cover a wide range of specialized manufacturing techniques from crystal growth, polishing including superpolishing, single point diamond turning, magneto optical finishing (MTF), segmented waveplates, anti-reflection, high reflection, and high laser damage threshold (HLDT) coatings, and adhesive free bonding. Furthermore aerospace and defense prime contractors rely on G&H to design and manufacture complex opto-mechanical assemblies.

22479,Dan T. Moore Company,"fter building his first motorcycle at age 14, Dan Moore started his first business, a tree service, before he’d even graduated from high school. With one truck and a couple of employees, he put himself through college and lit the spark that began his career as a successful entrepreneur and businessman. Since then, he has taken his innovative mind across the industrial spectrum: from the semi-conductor industry to basic materials science to the big five automotive companies.   

Dan’s earliest ventures were in the automobile industry where he developed a rust-proofing material for Ford and GM chassis. After finding early success in this industry, he branched out into polymers and plastics where he started and sold multiple businesses.   

In addition to continually starting and growing new businesses, Dan has found his way into managing multiple companies in turnaround and distressed situations. His style has always been hands-on and working directly with management and engineering to build a solution that can bring a company back to life.   

Moving forward at Dan T. Moore Company, we are following what has always been Dan’s simple plan: identify a need and develop a cost efficient way to fill that need. On average, we start one company each year with internally generated technology designed to fill these unmet needs. We also make controlling investments in companies in high growth industries and in distressed situations. To learn more about our investment process click here."

As Japan's automobile industry grew, The Bridgestone Group expanded its business to become Japan's largest tire manufacturer. The company also actively expanded overseas, particularly in Asia. In 1988, the company acquired The Firestone Tire & Rubber Company, a well respected global corporation with a venerable history of its own.

23715,BancFirst,"**_Oklahomans Banking Oklahoma_**

We're BancFirst. Unlike many banks these days, we've always been very clear on who we are and where we're going. Partly because we've never lost sight of where we came from.

First and foremost, we're proud to call ourselves an Oklahoma bank. In fact, our banking lineage goes all the way back to the Run of '89, so our roots go deep in Oklahoma soil. Over the years, BancFirst has grown from a confederation of community banks throughout the state, to a multi-bank holding company, to the largest state chartered bank in Oklahoma. Today, we have locations in small towns and large cities throughout the state.

When we say that we're an Oklahoma bank, we mean that our business identity has always been built around a commitment to Oklahoma and Oklahomans. That commitment has never changed and has brought us a great deal of success. Over the years it has developed into precepts that are at the very heart of our business philosophy.

  *  ** _We believe it's important to be actively, personally involved in the communities we serve: we participate._**

  *  ** _We believe it's important to invest our resources in those communities: we keep Oklahoma dollars in Oklahoma._**

  *  ** _We believe that prosperity flows from the honest effort put forth each day by each of us: we work hard._**

There may be banks with more locations and banks with lots of offices in other states, but no bank anywhere can match our loyalty to Oklahoma. At BancFirst, we've always thought it was good business to put Oklahoma first. We still do.

As a prospective employee, it's important that you understand the way we look at our business and our attitude toward our fellow Oklahomans.

 **You 'll Like Our Style**

BancFirst's business ""style"" flows naturally out of who we are - Oklahomans. That means you can expect a friendly, helpful attitude when you work with us, as well as pride in the contribution we make every day to Oklahoma's prosperity.

It also means a natural preference for doing business up close and personal. While we've never been slow to take advantage of technological opportunities, we've also never lost sight of a basic banking truth: that ultimately, every banking relationship is a relationship between people. That's why so much of our business is built on long-term relationships with customers. We take the time to work with our customers at their places of business. That way, we can develop a first-hand understanding of their goals and ambitions. When you work with BancFirst, you can expect a genuine commitment to help you select the proper mix of financial tools to help you succeed.

 **Our Unique Structure Gives You Unique Advantages**

Success is the result of careful decision-making which results from a forthright exchange of information. We've always believed that that kind of exchange is best made face to face, and that's why we've evolved the unique corporate structure that serves our customers so well. The BancFirst way is local empowerment: we place handpicked decision-makers in each of our banks and give them wide-ranging responsibility for their locations.

Our structure means you can count on access to capable professionals who have the authority to get things done for you promptly, without having to obtain approval from an out-of-state home office. That's true at every BancFirst location throughout Oklahoma, and that's not something every bank in Oklahoma can say.

 **Strength And Stability - Yesterday, Today, And Tomorrow**

At the same time, we never lose sight of the fact that our asset quality is the bedrock of our success. With BancFirst, you can be confident that your business is backed by a bank with the capital strength to serve you over the long haul. We'll be here when you need us, with all the financial resources you'll need to achieve the goals you set for yourself and your business.

 **Service Is Our Top Priority**

Every business poses a financial challenge that demands flexibility and responsiveness from its bank. We understand that you need quick action and unique solutions for your particular situation. In short, what you need from your bank is what you give to your customers: quality service.

To us, quality service is being available when you need us, with the answer or product that satisfies your need, so that you will be able to capitalize on opportunities and maximize your potential.

 **Excellence Is Standard**

From the teller's window to the loan officer's desk, BancFirst has assembled a statewide network of decision-makers who pledge to give you a superior level of customer service.

BancFirst is a team of Oklahomans committed to banking Oklahoma today and tomorrow, just as we did yesterday.

Come to BancFirst and let us show you that ""Oklahomans Banking Oklahoma"" is more than just a slogan.

### Who We Are

At PCA, we think of ourselves as more than a box manufacturer. We are an ideas and solutions company. We seek to be the leader in helping our customers -- large and small -- package, transport and display products of all kinds. It just happens to be that corrugated products are our area of expertise.

So a partnership with PCA isn't just about buying boxes. It's about building a relationship with a knowledgeable, trusted, committed source; adding value to your business; and actively contributing to your success in the marketplace.

Whether you are looking for conventional shipping containers, custom-printed corrugated boxes, custom packaging or eye-catching retail visual displays, PCA is here to deliver the right packaging solution on time and on budget.

### Why We Do What We Do

At PCA, our people are as sharp at posing questions as they are at providing answers. With good reason… We realize that the key to offering responsive customer service is never taking our customers for granted. That's why at the same time you're learning about our products and how we do business, we're learning about yours.

So don't be surprised if PCA people collaborate more than you're used to, or engage you in conversations that go beyond flute profiles and stacking strength. For PCA people, it's all about understanding customer service -- doing our very best to give you the ideas and products that support your needs."

•We develop technology that improves lives, like integrations that let you pay a mortgage using your voice.

But awards can’t replace big ideas. That’s why we’re committed to a workplace where every voice is heard and all team members have the opportunity to become the best versions of themselves.

24687,Association Member Benefits Advisors, Ltd,"Our story began in 1981 when an association was searching for a Medicare supplement policy and turned to David Morgan. His research on this subject sparked an interest and he began building a company that addressed the supplemental insurance needs of retired teachers. United Teacher Associates (UTA) was founded in 1981 to meet this need.   

In 1984, UTA acquired the American Consumers Life Insurance Company, founded in 1958, and renamed it United Teacher Associates Insurance Company (UTAIC). This enabled UTA to sell and service its own policies through UTAIC. In 1999, UTAIC & UTA were acquired by Great American Life Insurance Company.   

In 2001, David and Jerry Morgan founded Association Member Benefits Advisors to make benefits available for all other association clients in the United States. We have worked hand-in-hand with our clients since 2001 to create unique solutions for the benefit needs of their members.   

In order for AMBA to rise to the level of service we wanted to achieve, we needed to find the right partner to get us there. Our search led us to Genstar Capital. Genstar saw the potential that AMBA has and is assisting us in growing to improve and expand products and services for our clients. In 2017, Genstar invested in AMBA so that we, and our clients, can rise to a new level of success. David knows AMBA is in good hands due to Genstar’s continued track record of success. He was able to retire and take a break from the hard work he started in 1981 that became AMBA. Our success would never have happened had it not been for his company vision and dedication to the educator market."

For over 80 years, the company’s name has been symbolic of its heritage. The word “steak” stood for STEAKBURGER. The term “shake” stood for hand-dipped MILK SHAKES. Gus was determined to serve his customers the finest burgers and shakes in the business. To prove his point that his burgers were exceptionally prime, he would wheel in a barrel of steaks (including round, sirloin, and T-bones) and grind the meat into burgers right in front of the guests. Hence arose the origin of our famous slogan, “In Sight It Must Be Right.”

After 80 years, we are continuing Steak n Shake’s tradition of serving the country’s best, freshest, and tastiest burgers and shakes."
